# full-car-model
Implementation of a full car model with 7-DOF
(4 displacement associated tire, 1 displacement associated mass of the vehicle, 2 rotation associated pitch and roll)
in python code, numerical method Runge-Kutta 4th order with 14 equations of first order.

For obtain of equations of motion, Newton-Euler method was used.
